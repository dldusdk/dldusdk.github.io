**Welcome to my blog!
**
I believe just like little plants, we need consistient watering of **hard learning** and lots of beautiful sun from our most favourite **hobbies** to grow into our best selves.

**My current hobbies are:
**
<3 Badminton (stress relief -= 1000)
<3 Drawing random fruits being happy 
<3 Reading fiction! (I've been through my non-fiction stage for long enough...)
<3 Baking! (best compliment you could give me is 'it's not too sweet')
<3 Playing computer games (currently hooked on: Supermarket Simulator)

**I'm currently learning about:**
  Personal:
  <3 Animating with Blender (I want my fruits to come alive!!!)
  <3 Languages - I love being able to communicate with people of all sorts of languages! 
    <3 currently studying: mandarin chinese, 
  <3 Ethics and Morality problems (should I change the train tracks or not?)
  


  Professional:
