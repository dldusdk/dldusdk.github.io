<em> As of 02/05/2024...</em>

I am a recently graduated student from the University of Canterbury with a BSc in Computer Science and Philosophy. I have been honoured to be a part of the customer service industry in the last 5+ years with roles ranging from sales assistant, private motor vehicle claims consultant, application support specialist and technology helpdesk analyst. I aspire to make a difference in the world, to impact my community positively and to leave a good lasting trace. I have a passion for learning cyber security (and everything tech) and aspire to upskill to serve my community and to satisfy my desire for learning!
