This project was a lot of fun. 

This was my first group project (not really a group if its two...) and after hearing many horror stories on reddit and our university facebook group about group projects, I was worried.

Luckily - I was met with a really amazing partner! Communication was spot on, contributed to the ideas and conversations around the concept of our task well, and the best thing is we became good friends!
I really appreciate friendship, so I was really glad to have met a friend through something I thought was quite afraid of.

Initially at the beginning of the project, it was difficult to understand exactly what our task or requirements were, one thing for sure though, we had big big BIGGGG ambitions.
