This project was also a bit scary for me, but this time I felt more excitement than fear due to working in a group. I am normally someone who loves talking and getting to know people, I also love to learn from people no matter if it is life advice or something related to my course! I believe no matter what position we are in we always have something to learn from someone. Having a group of four was fun nonetheless, more collaboration, more people to talk to and get to know and befriend! <br>

Initially, getting together and discussing the app, it was very enjoyable and easy-going. We had a very good idea from one of our team mates on helping stop gambling addicition (although it seemed like he was a gambler himself so that was ironic). I enjoyed the idea, it was humourous but also at the same time, addressed a real-life problem.<br>

I began to plan out the wireframe, and only halfway done realized that everyone else in othergroups were doing it on Figma whilst I was hand-drawing my wireframes on my Dell XPS13 2-in-1 ðŸ¥‡. I felt a bit old-fashioned then, but my team mates did not mind at all!<br>

Beginning development, we immediately faced a hurdle, 3/4 (everyone but me!) group members were taking another course, that meant a huge chunk of their mind and time was focused on something else. It was known to be quite a difficult course, heavy on group-work and coding. So, the workload started to become off-balanced with most of the members focusing on that particular course. I did start to feel quite stressed at this point, feeling my fear of group projects coming to life, however, as someone who enjoys communicating and initiating leadership, I attempted to start the communication chain as much as possible to get involved in our project and designate tasks. Thankfully, with everyone's collaboration we managed to make it to the end - definitely not without any challenges though.<br>

Towards the end of the development was also the end of the other courses development, many of our team members were focused on the other course. I did my best to manage my stress by doing what I could to with the time we had left - even if that meant taking a all nighter to finish up. Many frustrations did arise due to features that were working started to not work (juuuust typical) - only until, one of the group members told us he managed to get an extension for the development of the app (is this a blessing or a curse?). And so - we spent the weekend finishing up the app!<br>

And I present betZer0:<br>

Above, is the homescreen! When you start the app you will be welcomed with a bit of insight about the app. Then there is a Life countdown, this was a suggestion I made as I frequently use Notion and one of the widgets there is to enter your age and it automatically calculates your life percentage in year, month, week, day, based on an average life expectency! The first time I saw this - I felt scared, knowing I was 27% already through my life made me look at what I did every day and think twice about the choices I make everyday, so I thought maybe if we put it here the user can feel a sense of 'fear' and want to take control over how they spend their time?! <br>

The main features of the app was the 'Daily Logs' and the 'Financial Analysis'. I managed the Daily Logs, and the SOS Screen. As you can see above, the mood selection screen requires you to select a mood based on the icons, record a voice memo and provides you with a general gambling motivation quote! This was my task, and man was it a huge learning experience. I had no issues with the recording or getting access to record the memos, but rather, making the memos saved in persistent storage! That was a frustrating, huge challenge but rewarding nevertheless when I saw my recordings still there after closing the app... <br>

Overall - this was a really good experience to working in larger groups in more of a educational environment, and exposure to Kotlin. It defintely inspired more app ideas for me for action one day!
