 <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Who am I ?</h2> 
As of April 5th 2024, I am a student at University of Canterbury currently completing the last year of my Bachelor of Science programme!
I major in Computer Science and Philosophy, specializing in Cyber Security and Morals and Ethics.

 <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Why Computer Science? </h3> 
During the last years of my high school time, I was unsure about the path of my future future. I wasn't sure whether to study neurology and be away from home for three years with uncertainty of where I wanted to go with my career.
Or whether I keep prodding my love and interest of the ever growing technology field we have today. In the end, I decided the lifestyle I wanted was with technology, although I wasn't 100% sure exactly where I wanted to go within the field, I knew I wanted to make contributions and help grow tech to aid our lives. 

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Why Cyber Security? </h4> 
During my first year of Univeristy, we had a compuslory course where the content was about Discrete Mathematics and a little bit of Cryptography. From a young age I always enjoyed **pure** mathematics, so I felt immensely intrigued and fascinated when cryptography was introduced me. I thought "How come I have never encountered this before?". It really felt like a whole new world. In fact I enjoyed it so much that I remember emailing the lecturer about possible career paths within cryptography such as lecturing and being a professor! 

> Hello, \
> My name is Michelle Lee I'm currently a computer science and philosophy major. I am currently enrolled in your MATH120 course and I was wondering if you would be available to discuss career options in cryptography?\
> I'm very interested in the subject and I would like to pursue further studies in it, however I wanted to discuss whether it would be a viable option and how realistic it would be.\
> Thank you,\

However after that I went through a challenging phase of my life, I ended up falling behind with my studies, ended up going part-time and then finally, I took a break from studies in 2021. I moved up to Auckland in mid-2022, worked full time for a IT company and just simply took a break. \

When I returned to University in 2023, I rekindled with my hobbies and passion within the vast world of Computer Science. I dabbled in a bit of Data Science (interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) and practiced on kaggle. However, it didn't feel right for me, and one day, after choosing my courses for the last year of University (2024), there I saw it! Cryptography and Discrete Mathematics. **How could I have forgotten?!** Immediatley, I wanted to know how I could apply my love of pure mathematics to the other passion of mine: computer science.

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Why Philosophy? </h3> 
I'm not going to lie to you and say that I have been an aspiring Philosophist from a young age, who read Kant and Plato while other teenagers played video games.
In fact, the only 'philosophy' I encountered during my young times was writing 'what is the meaning of life' countless times in mandarin on my high school textbooks.

Honestly, I didn't have a clear direction or meaning to my life at that time. I was a bit lost, however, time went on and during my first year of University I took a Philosophy paper to fill my degree.
When I sat in my first philosophy class, the lecturer, Michael. J.T was the most inspiring, humourous, uplifiting lecturer I had encountered. I felt so inspired from him that ultimatley, his passion for Phillsophy radiated onto me and that encounter was what made me pursue Philsophy.
