 <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Who am I ?</h2> 
As of April 5th 2024, I am a student at University of Canterbury currently completing the last year of my Bachelor of Science programme!/ 
I major in Computer Science and Philosophy, specializing in Cyber Security and Morals and Ethics.

 <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Why Computer Science? </h3> 
During the last years of my high school time, I was considering my future very seriously. I wasn't sure whether I wanted to study neurology and be away from home for three years with uncertainty of where I wanted to go with my career.
Or whether I keep prodding my love and interest of the ever growing technology field we have today. 

Why Cyber Security?


<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Why Philosophy? </h3> 
I'm not going to lie to you and say that I have been an aspiring Philosophist from a young age, who read Kant and Plato while other teenagers played video games. / 
In fact, the only 'philosophy' I encountered during my young times was writing 'what is the meaning of life' countless times in mandarin on my high school textbooks. 
BLOCK 生活的意思是什么
Needless to say, I didn't have a great meaning to my life at that time. I was a bit lost, however, time went on and during my first year of University I took a Philosophy paper to fill my degree.\
When I sat in my first philosophy class, the lecturer, Michael. J.T was the most inspiring, humourous, uplifiting lecturer I had encountered. I felt so inspired because he radiated purpose and meaning to each of his words and
it was what made me fall in love with philosophy.
