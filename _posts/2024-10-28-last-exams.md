 <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Last Exams forever?</h2> 
I haven't made a post here in a while!

Currently - it is my last exam season for my Bachelors degree. I cannot wait to finish up and use my newly gained freedom to study more specific topics I am interested in. More time will be spent on HTB and tryhackme for sure :)

Also, I hope to study towards some certificates to help me gain more foundational knowledge and also allow me to learn more with a goal in mind!

I will use this platform as a blog to document my journey over the upcoming years. 

One of the biggest things I would love to do is update the website to be more modern and have a couple more interactive features like comments and country visit flags. 

I also want to develop a badminton scoring app to help small clubs and tournments easily manage their scores for each game and be able to export the scores onto the badminton scoring sheets! Hopefully that will come up in the upcoming year.

On a side note - today I watched the movie 'Lookback'. I went in blind, not knowing a single thing about the movie and man, was it good. It made me feel a whirlwind of emotions! Happy, worried and sad. I definitely recommend it!
